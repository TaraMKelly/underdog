Flatiron School Flagship Final Project

I built an application where sports fans can view games, see their odds, pick who they want to win, and discuss their stragegy with other betters.

The app includes validations, where users can sign up, log in, and log out, the ability to view games, choose teams and whether the game will go under or over a certain point total, and a comment section to chat with other users.

Build using React for the front end and Ruby on Rails for the backend API.

Used a 3rd party API to fetch live game and odds data.
